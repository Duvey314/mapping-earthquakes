# Mapping Earthquakes

This project uses the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. The tectonic plates are represented by a bright blue line. Both of these map layers can be toggled on or off using the layerGroup method. The type of base map can be changed from the upper right control box as well.
